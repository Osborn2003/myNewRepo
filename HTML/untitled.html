              <p>“I do not love him..” I said. “If anyone should be punished at all, it should be me. I saved him; he was in the woods wounded, cold and alone. I couldn't let him die..” I wip my eyes; they were welling up and I didn't want the tears or it makes me feel vulnerable. “I still can't let him die.”</p>
